Before we begin, copy the template from the following code block:

```markdown

title: your name
date: yyyy-mm-dd
image: https://placekitten.com/400/300 #optional
imageAlt: A cute cat #optional, mandatory if you add an image

Replace this piece of text with your cool quote 😎, words of wisdom
🧙🏽‍♂️ or even a simple Hi!👋... Anything that isn't offensive / NSFW!

## [optional] Gif that describes you right now

```

Let's get started:

1. Head over to the [Posts folder in the GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Amorpheuz/gatsby-conditional-builds-demo/tree/dev/content/posts).
   Click on <span role="img" aria-label="Drop down arrow">`Add File 🔽`</span> button on top right, then on `Create new file`. You should see the screen in the following picture, if you are logged
   into GitHub account with the account email verified.

2. Create a file with `your-name.mdx` format, e.g. `john-doe.mdx`. Feel free to mix it up with numbers if your name is already taken.

3. Paste the template, and fill in the info. Be sure to remove lines marked as `optional` if you don't feel like filling those up!

4. You should see a screen similar to this now, with your content instead of the template:

5. Scroll down, and click on the green `Propose new file` button. The browser will load a page titled `Comparing changes`.

6. Click on the green `Create pull request` button.

7. Next, change the title which says `Create your-name.mdx` to your `Add your-name`.
   E.g., `Create john-doe.mdx` gets changed to `Add John Doe`.

8. Scroll down and review the changes for one final time. Once done, click on the green `Create pull request` button.

9. Your pull request will be created, and you should see a GitHub action getting triggered. Click on the blue `Details` to the right
   to preview the GitHub Action in action!

10. If everything was done correctly, the Action will complete with a green <span role="img" aria-label="Tick mark">✅</span> next to it.

Congratulations <span role="img" aria-label="Woo hoo confetti explosions">🎉🎉</span>! Your signing was successful, I will be reviewing your Pull Request and once all looks good, I will approve it
making your entry live on the website.

Thank you for signing! <span role="img" aria-label="Heart">❤</span>
